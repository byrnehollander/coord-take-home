# Byrne's Coord Take-Home

This app asks users to pick a location within NYC and tells them how many parking spots are within walking distance at the current time. 

1. What is walking distance?

For this app, walking distance is defined as 0.3km (around 1000 feet). [Some researchers have defined walking distance as "no more than 0.25 miles (or 0.40 km)"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377942/), but acknowledge that distance varies depending on  purpose and population group. [Others have argued for 300-600 feet for retail customers](https://trid.trb.org/view/859431#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20lack%20of,as%20great%20as%202%2C000%20feet.), so I just settled on 1000 feet.

2. How big is a parking spot?

Different cars require different sized parking spaces. [Some sources](https://franklinst.com/how-large-is-a-parking-space/) say a standard parallel parking spot is 20 feet long, but I went with 5.5 meters (~18 feet) for this challenge. A Toyota Camry is 16 feet long, so this will work for Camrys (as long as nothing is partially parked in the spot).

3. What counts as a parking spot? Can only certain kinds of vehicles can park there?

I found these parking spots with the [Coord 'Rules at a point in time for curbs near a location' API](https://www.coord.com/api#/reference/0/rules-at-a-point-in-time-for-curbs-near-a-location/find-the-rules-for-curbs-near-a-location-at-a-certain-time). All these parking spaces are currently available (excluding the `time` parameter uses the current time by default), have parking as a `permitted_use`, and support all `vehicle_type`s.


4. How does the user input their location?

Users will use the enter their NYC address into the autocomplete input box. The component is from the [react-places-autocomplete](https://github.com/hibiken/react-places-autocomplete) project but is very much unstyled (sorry!), and uses the [Google Maps Places Library](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places) and the [Google Maps Geocoder API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding).

Unfortunately, these APIs cost money per request, so I've limited them to 100 requests/day. Additionally, if you select an address outside of the five boroughs, the app does not make a call to the Geocoder API.

Where can I park my Toyota Camry in NYC?
## How to run locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so it should look pretty familiar if you've used CRA before.

## Create a `.env` file

You can run `cp .env.sample .env` and set values for both `REACT_APP_COORD_ACCESS_KEY` and `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY` in `.env`. Then, run `source .env`.
### `yarn start`

After the environment variables are set, run `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.

Then, open [http://localhost:3000/coord-take-home](http://localhost:3000/coord-take-home) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
