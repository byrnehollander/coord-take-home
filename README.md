# Coord Take-Home

Where can I park my Toyota Camry in NYC?

* Make an application that asks the user to pick a location *within NYC* and tells them how many parking spots are within walking distance at the current time.

"Walking distance" is defined as any distance no more than 0.25 miles (or 0.40 km)
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377942/, though arguments for as little as 300 feet for retail customers (https://trid.trb.org/view/859431#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20lack%20of,as%20great%20as%202%2C000%20feet.)


* To do this, you will use the Coord API. Here is an example of a request to our API:

Some things to think about as you complete this challenge:

1. What is walking distance? How big is a parking spot?
2. What counts as a parking spot? What if only certain kinds of vehicles can park there?
3. How should the user input their location? You are welcome to integrate with third party services like Google Maps or Mapbox, but are not required to do so.

We expect you to spend 1-2 hours on this challenge. You are welcome to use the language of your choice. Include a README file on how to build (if necessary) and run your application.
